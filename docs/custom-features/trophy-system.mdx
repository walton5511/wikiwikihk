# Olympus Trophy System

## How to obtain Trophies

- Raids drop a specific trophy to that raid (different trophies for different raids).
- There is a counter system of 50 on raid boxes that affects trophies only, the counter doesn't reset until it's completed.

## Useful information

- A Trophy can be sold to NPCs for 1kk gold.
- Only one trophy can be equipped at one time.
- Major Trophies' upgrade to last tier will trigger an announcement.

## Major trophies
Once you collected 10 minor trophies, you can exchange them for one Major trophy.  
A Major trophy can be upgraded two times, and their tier will be specified in their name.  
Upon crafting a major trophy, you get the first tier of it.

Major trophies can be upgraded with a **Trophy Upgrade** item ![](https://i.imgur.com/VdsanI5.png) which you can buy from Nemo (NosVille, next to level 1 Time-Space). keep in mind that the **upgrade won't always be successful**.
