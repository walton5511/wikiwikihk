### Sp3 - Questline

####  Beforehand
Like the Sp1 and Sp2 Questsline, there TimeSpaces are gone but unlinke the other two Sp Questlines are not replaced my killing monsters. So it is just shortened and also some of the needed item amounts were reduced. Another change is, that everything has a 100% droprate.
In case of accidently deleting a quest item, you can buy then again from the treasure box next to the Soulstone for 1kk each as seen below:
