## What is Bidding System?

## Useful information

:::tip Tips & Tricks
- Bidding System uses bank for transactions. If you would like to take part in auction, make sure you have enough gold in it, because money is consumed right after each bid. If anyone beats your offer, cash will be sent back to your bank account instantly.
- Auction Center currency is 'kk' (for example, 5000kk = 5b)
- Use 'Speakers' option in details of your own auctions to let more people know about your item. It will surely help you to get your bids the highest as possible!
- After first bid is added, you can't take your item out as seller. Think twice before you put your equipment into auction. Same goes with bids - if your bid won, that means you have made transaction and can't undo it.
