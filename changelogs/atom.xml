This includes nerfing the res reduction of Pix to balance res drain builds, and doubling Caligor durability so that more people can gather enough participation points.
Also, we wanted to make Jennifer hat be equal to our latest Ceremonial Hat from Act7, and be obtainable from Rainbow Random Boxes to make RBB a bit more rewarding.</p><ul><li><p>Reduced Mysterious Traveller's respawn timer from 2h to 1h.</p></li><li><p>Added Jennifer's Feathered Hat to the Rainbow Random Box as a very rare loot.</p></li><li><p>Jennifer's Feathered Hat:</p><ul><li>Defense: 0/0/0 -&gt; 50/50/50</li><li>Dodge: 0 -&gt; 40</li><li><span style="color:#ff862c">Up to level 4 there is a 10% -&gt; 15% chance of never getting a bad effect.</span></li><li><font color="orange">[NEW]</font> <span style="color:#ff862c">Damage received in PvP is decreased by 10%.</span></li></ul></li><li><p>[Pix' Blessing]<!-- -->:</p><ul><li><span style="color:#ff862c">Reduces the enemy's elemental resistances by 10 -&gt; 7.</span></li><li><span style="color:#ff862c">The equipped fairy's element increases by 5 -&gt; 7.</span></li></ul></li><li><p>Chronos Hourglass (I/II/III):</p><ul><li><font color="#fd4949">[REMOVE]</font> <span style="color:#ff862c">There's a 50/75/100% chance to ignore 10/15/60% of the target's defence.</span></li><li><font color="orange">[NEW]</font> <span style="color:#ff862c">Decreases enemy's defense by 5/10/20%.</span></li></ul></li><li><p>Doubled Caligor's durability with damage reduction readjustments:</p><ul><li><span style="color:#ff862c">There is a 100% chance that damage received from melee attacks is reduced by 50 -&gt; 75%.</span></li><li><span style="color:#ff862c">There is a 100% chance that damage received from ranged attacks is reduced by 80 -&gt; 90%.</span></li><li><span style="color:#ff862c">There is a 100% chance that damage received from magic attacks is reduced by 40 -&gt; 70%.</span><br><br></li></ul></li><li><img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/10163.png" width="15px"> [Despair]:<br>- Duration: 25s -&gt; 10s<br><br></li><li><img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/10163.png" width="15px"> [Incapacitated]:<br>- <font color="#fd4949">[REMOVE]</font> <span style="color:#ff862c">Calculated Attack Level 0</span><br>- <font color="#fd4949">[REMOVE]</font> <span style="color:#ff862c">Calculated Defense Level 0</span><br>- <font color="orange">[NEW]</font> <span style="color:#ff862c">Attack level is decreased by 7.</span><br><br></li><li><img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/10191.png" width="15px"> [Cut]:<br>- <span style="color:#ff862c">Reduces remaining MP by 70% -&gt; 50%</span><br><br></li><li><img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/10140.png" width="15px"> [Fatal Bleeding]:<br>- <font color="orange">[NEW]</font> <span style="color:#ff862c">Magic attacks are reduced by 20%.</span><br><br></li><li><img src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/10189.png" width="15px"> [Cold]:<br>- 5 -&gt; 4Lv.

Maximum champion level has been increased from 50 to 60.
Moritius (Act7) can be accessed by starting the questline from Merchant Ben in Alveus Port, if you're already CLv.30+.
Following the questline will unlock you access to Celestial Spire, Act7 raids, three side quests, and seven daily quests.
Since the questline is essential to the Act, we have tried to do some improvements on the it to make it more enjoyable and rewarding.
Additionally, useless side/daily quests of Act7 are removed so you won't have a clutter of trash quests stuck with your character.
Three of the remaining seven dailies are unlocked as you finish the raid quests in the main questline, and the quests are just killing mobs to get raid seals.
Other four dailies are gated behind side quests, which all get unlocked upon completing the Act7.1 questline.
Finishing those side quests will unlock you the four dailies that you can do to get materials and even CExp.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="farming">Farming<a class="hash-link" href="#farming" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Mob placements and mob counts in almost all maps have been reworked.
Some changes were design-related mob type replacements and removals, and some were for making certain maps feel a bit more rewarding to farm.
Mobs in each map now have a specific drop used in equipment crafts but they drop quite often so you won't feel forced to farm in non-preferred maps for long.
You can use our newest feature to check the mob and map drops in Act7 yourself.</p><p>Four rifts have been placed in Act7: Spirit Forest, Beast Lair, Polluted Forest, and Celestial Spire V.
The rifts at Celestial Spire V is special cause once you get in, you can teleport/warp freely to all 5 floors of the Spire within the rift.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="raids">Raids<a class="hash-link" href="#raids" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Though we haven't touched the mechanics of our new three raids, they have been repurposed in some way, considering their default situation.
In a nutshell: Spirit King Kirollas for tattoos, Beast King Carno for runes, Demon God Belial for equipment.
Of course, they're all meant to be "worth", as long as you have use for the materials that they give, and they can still be subject to rate changes after we gather enough data and feedback.
We know that once people are done with their main grind, focus of the community may shift to the most profitable raid.
But this is simply a way to give them a specific purpose and also to make higher rune and tattoo upgrades possible and relevant.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="runes-and-tattooes">Runes and Tattooes<a class="hash-link" href="#runes-and-tattooes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>You can access the rune guide here: <a href="https://wiki.olympusgg.com/information/runes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click</a><br>
You can access the tattoo guide here: <a href="https://wiki.olympusgg.com/information/tattoos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click</a><br><br>
The protection scrolls and removal items can be found in Logotor's Equipment Shop.
Logotor also sells two brand new items: Tattoo Switch Scroll and Loa Switch Crystal.
These can be used to switch your tattoo and/or your loa, without losing your upgrade level.
We wanted to encourage our players trying new builds through different tattooes so that tattooes won't feel too repetitive or bland.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="equipment--trophies">Equipment &amp; Trophies<a class="hash-link" href="#equipment--trophies" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>You can access the equipment guide here: <a href="https://wiki.olympusgg.com/guides/act7-equipment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click</a><br><br>
Three new trophies are added to Mysterious Monk.
These trophies are meant to be PvP-oriented, even though our previous ones had functions in PvP too, we wanted a specialized generation of PvP trophies.
They can basically be classified as: offense for Vengeful Tombstone, defense for Athena's Aegis, mixed for Helm of Darkness.
We will be looking forward to see their place in the game and rebalance them if needed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="valhalla">Valhalla<a class="hash-link" href="#valhalla" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Valhalla Part1 &amp; Part2 has been implemented.
These quests are mainly an alternative for solo levelling without having to farm in Act5.2 or LoD.
Part1 questline can be started by Barni's Soul in NosVille near God's Altar at 85Lv. It'll bring you to Lv.90 by its end.
After completing Part1, Part2 quests can be obtained from Ragnar at the entrance of Rock Cliff.
Finishing Valhalla Part2 and Act5.2 questlines will bring you near 99Lv.
These quests are mainly an alternative for new players to level up solo without having to farm in Act5.2 or LoD. You'll still need to farm though, to get enough resources to build a character.</p><p>Fafnir Raid &amp; achievements have been implemented.
Key to Fafnir's Castle can be bought from the Mysterious Monk in NosVille or can be dropped by the monsters in Midgard just north of Maple Woods.
Raid entrance is on the Castle Aria Int. map, near Midgard.
In the raidbox, you can find divine fairies, fairy essences, Viking costumes, and even an Unidentified Egg that randomly turns into Zenas or Erenia's Egg.
As a percentage raid, the raid is made fast and easy. Consequently, the chance for rare loots mentioned above had to be kept low.
It also contains Fafnir's Fried Dinner which can be used to cleanse Lv.3 and lower debuffs in all sorts of situations.
All things considered, we think it's worthy to do some Fafnir maras for an easy flow of direct gold if not for all the rare loot.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="sp-changes">SP Changes<a class="hash-link" href="#sp-changes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>You can access the changelog for SPs here: <a href="https://wiki.olympusgg.com/release-reworks/act7-sp-changelog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click</a><br><br></p>]]></content>
